# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the starter code for the project. I started by forking and cloning the original repository. Then I built upon it to practice my HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, as well as my Node, Express back-end skills.

## Dependencies

- Express
- Node 5.10.x or above
- Body Parser
- Chance
- MD5
- TimeAgo
- Nodedemon (not required for running, used server-side)

## Features

This project employs the following features from this week's learning material. 

### Flexbox & Responsive Design

This project uses Flexbox for layout and design in all elements. It makes use of Flexbox's adaptability to have responsive design across media types with different layouts for mobile/tablet and desktop clients.  

### AJAX Requests

This project uses AJAX requests to update the existing tweets container when a new tweet is submitted via AJAX post request. No loading of the page is necessary for the tweet database to update on screen! 

### Cross-Site Scripting Protection

This project makes use of a JavaScript escape function to avoid cross-site scripting. Safety first! 

### CSS & SASS 

This project uses Sass to organize, nest, and simplify the CSS, including variables, modules, and mixins.
